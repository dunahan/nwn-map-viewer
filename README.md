Neverwinter Nights Player Location Tools

With this tool, NWNx2 and the NWNX_Systemdata2-PlugIn (which writes the needed coordinates in a INI-File) you can track your players, creature-spawns (NESS-System-like, spawn per waypoints) or useable placeables on your server.

It needs minimaps, created by minimap-exporter (https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/nwn1-utility-package) or other programs.
